Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If even , the algorithm divides it by two , and if n is odd , the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one . For example , the sequence for n = 3 is as follows:
        3--->10--->5--->16--->8--->4--->2--->1
Your task is to simulate the exceution of the algorithm for a given value of n;
Input : the only input line contains an integer n.
Output: Print a line that contains all values of n during an algorithm
Constraints : . 1<= n <= 10^6

Example:
input : 3
output: 3 10 5 16 8 2 1
